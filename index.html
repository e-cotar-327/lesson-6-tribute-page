            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Nikola Tesla was born in 1856 in Austria-Hungary and emigrated to the U.S. in 1884 as a physicist. He pioneered the generation, transmission, and use of alternating current (AC) electricity, which can be transmitted over much greater distances than direct current.</p>
            <p>Tesla patented a device to induce electrical current in a piece of iron (a rotor) spinning between two electrified coils of wire. This rotating magnetic field device generates AC current when it is made to rotate by using some form mechanical energy, like steam or hydropower. When the generated current reaches its user and is fed into another rotating magnetic field device, this second device becomes an AC induction motor that produces mechanical energy. Induction motors run household appliances like clothes washers and dryers. Development of these devices led to widespread industrial and manufacturing uses for electricity.</p>
            <p>The induction motor was only part of Tesla's overall conception. In a series of history-making patents, he demonstrated a polyphase alternating-current system, consisting of a generator, transformers, transmission layout, and motor and lights. From the power source to the power user, it provided the basic elements for electrical production and utilization. Our AC power system remains essentially unchanged today.In 1888, George Westinghouse, head of the Westinghouse Electric Company, bought the patent rights to Tesla's system of dynamos, transformers and motors. Westinghouse used Tesla's alternating current system to light the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago. Then in 1896, Tesla's system was used at Niagara Falls in the world's first large hydroelectric plant. The Tesla coil, invented in 1891, is still used in radio and television sets, car starters, and a wide variety of electronic equipment.</p>

            <p>Tesla's work with radio-frequency waves laid the foundation for today's radio. He experimented with wireless transmission of electrical power, and received 112 patents for devices ranging from speedometers to extremely efficient electrical generators to a bladeless turbine still in use today. He suggested that it was possible to use radio waves to detect ships (later developed as RADAR), and his work with special gas-filled lamps set the stage for the creation of fluorescent lighting.</p>
            <p>Tesla was Thomas Edison's rival at the end of the 19th century - in fact, he was more famous than Edison throughout the 1890's. His invention of polyphase AC electric power earned him worldwide fame but not fortune. At his zenith his circle of friends included poets and scientists, industrialists and financiers. Yet Tesla died alone and almost penniless in a New York hotel room in 1943. During his life, Tesla created a legacy of genuine invention that still fascinates today. After his death, the world honored him by naming the unit of magnetic flux density the "tesla."</p>

        <h2>Curiosities</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Nikola Tesla was born during a lightning storm</h5>
            <p>
              It's quite fitting that Tesla, the man whose research revolved around electricity was born during a lightning storm. Tesla was born around midnight between July 9 and July 10, 1856 in the Austrian empire. Legend has it that the midwife who was assisting Tesla's mother openly declared that the lightning was a bad omen and that Tesla would be child of darkness. On this, his mother said, "No, he will be child of the light"

            <h3>Tesla worked for Thomas Edison, and later became his competitor</h3>
            <p>Thomas Edison was a prolific American inventor. After Nikola Tesla arrived in the US, he worked as an assistant to Edison. However, he quit later to pursue his own project. Edison worked on direct current while Tesla worked on alternating current. This pitted both of them on either sides of 'current war'.</p>
            <p>Though they were competitors, they were not enemies. There was mutual respect. Once when Edison attended a speech given by Tesla, the latter led the audience in giving a standing ovation to Edison.</p>
            <p>When there were fires at Tesla's lab. Edison arranged for a lab for Tesla to continue his work.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Tesla developed the idea for smartphone technology</h3>
            <p>Tesla was ahead of his time. Once, he pitched an idea to his funder JP Morgan that involved encoding messages and broadcasting each of them on a specific frequency which then be received in a handheld device. The idea was instrumental in later research to develop smartphones.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Tesla scared Mark Twain</h3>
            <p>Residents living near Tesla's laboratory often said that he had an 'earthquake machine' that could shake the entire block. The machine was actually a high-frequency oscillator. Tesla once invited Mark Twain, the famous writer, to his lab and made him stand on a platform that was connected with the oscillator.</p>
            <p>Mark Twain had digestive problems. The platform shook so violently that it scared Twain into jumping off it and running for toilet facilities.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Tesla hated pearls. Like Really!</h3>
            <p>Tesla was known to be an eccentric genius. He hated pearls for some reason. His hate was so strong that he refused to talk with women who wore pearls. His secretary came to the lab wearing pearls one day. Tesla sent her home.</p>
